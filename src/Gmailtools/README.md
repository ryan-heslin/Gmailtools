**gmailtools**
Gmailtools is a set of command-line utilities I created that work with [Google's Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api). It incldues utility functions to automate tasks like marking emails read or applying filters, as well as a more complex program to query, parse, and optionally store your emails using Gmail's search syntax.

To use the application, you'll need to generate API credentials, store them in a file called `credentials.json` in the same directory as `gmailtools`, and grant authorization on first running the app.

Enjoy!
